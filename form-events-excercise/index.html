<!-- index.html already has a form element that contains two <input> elements, 
    one for quantity and one for a product name.  
    index.html also contains an empty <ul> where you will append new <li>'s.  
    Watch the gif at the bottom for an overview of how your code should work. 
    
    Your task is to follow these steps:
    Listen for the form submission
    When the form is submitted, prevent the default behavior
    Grab the quantity input value and the product input value
    Create a new <li> element.  Set the text on the new <li> to include the quantity and product name from the form.
    Append the new <li> to the <ul> on the page
    Reset the inputs
    
    Please note:
    1. Udemy's interface does not yet recognize some of the newer JS syntax, e.g., .append()
    You will need to use alternate (older) syntax for this method in order to get the tests to pass.
    2. The form will need to be assigned to a variable named form for the test to pass.
